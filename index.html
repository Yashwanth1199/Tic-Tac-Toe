                Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces
                in a three-by-three
                grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
                diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both
                players.

            <p>
                Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O
                in
                one of the nine spaces in the grid. In the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in
                seven steps: Game of Tic-tac-toe, won by X There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first,
                but in this article the convention that X plays first is used. Players soon discover that the best play
                from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have
                discovered the optimal strategy.
